# identifyTeam3
The idea for this application came from a friend who was working at Cambrian College in Sudbury, Ontario in the college Aboriginal Department.

He emphasized the importance to have a platform for Aboriginal students to self identify. His reason to have this platform was because the Aboriginal department has tons of resources to help students, they also hold many events, workshops, etc.

The problem facing the department is that many Aboriginal students arenâ€™t aware of the events, specific resources, or even the department itself. He wanted to have a specific medium to target these students to let them know what is going on in their school

Taking this idea, why not have an application that not only focuses on Aboriginal students, but other groups as well such as LGBQT, religious minorities, international students, etc.
