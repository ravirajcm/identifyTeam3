         "description":"Sexual Violence Prevention Week is designed to raise awareness of Algonquin’s commitment to being a safe community that is free of sexual violence, and to provide students with the resources they need to address the warning signs of sexual violence they see in our community. Along with an eight-week social media campaign, this awareness and prevention week features events where students can get information and support in an engaging and accessible way. Help us build a culture of safety and consent here at Algonquin College by checking out these events and joining in the conversation on social media. Visit us on Facebook here and Twitter here.",
